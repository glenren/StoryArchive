# Story Archive

## Description

This application is used to store original story worlds, including plot outlines, world-building details, characters, and images related to that world.

**Story Archive** is designed to help story builders store their ideas and creations in a single, easy to navigate application.

As someone who creates lots of characters and stories in my head, I wanted to have a place to store and organize my often disorganized thoughts.
