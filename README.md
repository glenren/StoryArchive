# Story Archive

## Description

This application is used to store original story worlds, including plot outlines, story chapters, world-building details, and characters related to that world.

**Story Archive** is designed to help story builders store their ideas and creations in a single, easy to navigate application.

As someone who creates lots of characters and stories in my head, I wanted to have a place to store and organize my often disorganized thoughts. The hope is that this program is helpful for achieving just that, not only for me but possibly even for others who are like me and share the same experience.
